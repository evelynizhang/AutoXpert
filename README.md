## Sales microservice

The Sales microservice tracks automobile sales of automobiles listed in the inventory microservice. Using a poller, the sales microservice is able to reference the inventory's  automobile resource data changes. Through its salesperson and customer resources, the sales microservice can link each automobile sale to a salesperson and a customer.
